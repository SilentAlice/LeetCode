# PyTorch Exercises

A collection of PyTorch exercises and practice problems covering various deep learning concepts.

## Structure

- `basics/` - Basic PyTorch operations and tensor manipulations
- `neural_networks/` - Simple neural network implementations
- `cnn/` - Convolutional Neural Network exercises
- `rnn/` - Recurrent Neural Network exercises
- `transformer/` - Transformer architecture exercises
- `optimization/` - Optimization techniques and training loops
- `datasets/` - Data loading and preprocessing exercises
- `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities

## Usage

Each exercise is self-contained and can be run independently:

```bash
python basics/tensor_operations.py
```

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## Learning Path

1. Start with `basics/` to understand tensor operations
2. Move to `neural_networks/` for basic MLP implementations
3. Explore `cnn/` for image processing
4. Study `rnn/` for sequence modeling
5. Learn `transformer/` for modern architectures
6. Practice `optimization/` for training techniques
